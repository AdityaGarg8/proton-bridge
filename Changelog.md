* #953 #984 First label messages before unlabeling when moving messages

    * Slight memory optimization
    * #1043 do not stuck in loop for updating message which does not exist anywhere anymore
    * #1034 fix UID dynamic range for empty list
    * fix of sequence number in IMAP IDLE expunge during deleting messages
    * #1030 #1028 Fix some crashes and bad auths
    * #953 #984 label messages first during moving them
* #964 (and #769,#899,#918,#930,#931,#949) refactor of IMAP
  - Fix of sequence number in IMAP IDLE expunge during deleting messages
  - Fix not-returning empty result for UID dynamic range as said in RFC
  - Separated IMAP to store and IMAP
  - Store is responsible for everything about db and calls to pmapi, including event loop, sync, address mode
  - IMAP is responsible only for IMAP interfaces
  - Event loop is only one per ProtonMail account (instead of one per alias)
  - It also means only one database per account (instead of one per address)
  - Changing address mode is not destroying database, only buckets with IDs mapping (keeping metadata for account)
  - Before first sync we set event ID so we will not miss changes happening during sync
  - Thanks to previous point we are not starting new sync when we finish first one because of unprocessed events
  - Sync is not blocking event loop (user can get new messages even during sync)
  - Sync is not blocking reading operations (user can list mailboxes even before first sync is done)
  - Sync is not blocking writing operations such as mark messages read/unread and so on
  - Most operations have to be passed to API and only event loop is writing them to the database
  - Avoid relying on counts API endpoint; use event counts as much as possible
  - Separate function for storing message content type and header into database
  - Sequence number optimised for last item in mailbox
  - Allow sending IMAP idle update to timeout to avoid blocking bridge
  - Synchronisation will create a label if not yet present
  - Labels and Folders (including system folders) are stored in DB together with their counts for offline read-out
  - AddressIDs for all user addresses are stored in DB
  - IMAP updates channel is set when an IMAP client connects (and IMAP updates are dropped until then)
  - DB keeps track of address mode (split/combined)
* Event loop starts as soon as user is initialised (i.e. logged in), not just when imap is connected
* Use pmapi v1.0.13
* Logout user if initialisation fails
* Send UserRefreshEvent on user login and logout
* Use godog v0.8.0 under new name 'cucumber' (instead of DATA-DOG)

### Fixed
* #1057 Logging in to an already logged in user would display unrelated error "invalid mailbox password"
* #1056 Changing mailbox password sometimes didn't log out user
* #1066 Split address mode can not work when credentials store is cleared
* #1071 Bridge can think it is in combined mode when actually it's in split mode
* Missing `enmime` dependency
* Issue where a failed sync was not attempted again
* Removing an address would crash bridge
* #1087 Accounts with capital letters could not be added
* #1087 Inactive addresses were not filtered out of the store
* #1087 Unlock with correct key if message is sent to alias and not primary (aka original) address
* #1109 Receiving an event referencing an address that isn't present could crash bridge
* Avoid concurrent map writes in imap backend
* GODT-103 User keys were not unlocked later if they were not unlocked during startup
